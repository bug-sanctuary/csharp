# Sanctuary for C# bugs

We all make mistakes and write some bad code from time to time.
But bugs are living creatures - and we should not just squash them whenever we cross paths with them! What cruel monsters we would be..

So please, if you find any C# bug in your code, don't just squash them, but preserve them in this lovely sanctuary :)
